# RodSimulator3000

This program simulates a rod being heated by a constant power heater. At the
moment it only prints:

 * Heat of the rod in joules
 * Length and diameter expansion in metres
 * Temperature of the rod in degrees Celius
 * Time elapsed between two prints. Usually around 1 second.

# Future

This is supposed to be a GUI program. Work in progress.
